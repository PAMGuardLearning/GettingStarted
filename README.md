# GettingStarted
Getting started with PAMGuard. Detecting clicks, whistles and some baleen whale sounds

This is a very basic PAMGuard tutorial which will introduce you to the following concepts:

1. Launching PAMGuard and selecting a configuration file
2. Running the click detector and using Target Motion Analysis to localise sperm whale clicks
3. Adding a whistle detector and detecting dolphin sounds
4. Using different detectors for baleen whale sounds

The tutorial uses pre recorded sound files from a number of sources. These are played back 
through PAMGuard, which processes the data in exactly the same way as it would were the 
data being acquired in real time. However, you MUST have a working sound card on your system
or the files will process at many times real time and you won't be able to see what's happening.
